# Here we will create a mono-repo that will have both the backend API and the frontend in React.
# The mono-repo idea is interesting because it shares common dependencies and allow front and backend to share types and some common definitions.

pnpm init   # this creates a package.json

pnpm create vite@latest web  # the name of the project is 'web'

# in this command select the options:
◇  Select a framework:
│  React
│
◇  Select a variant:
│  TypeScript
│
◇  Use rolldown-vite (Experimental)?:
│  No
│
◇  Install with pnpm and start now?
│  Yes


# After this initial setup, I cleaned the 'web' project, removing some stuff we're not going to use.
# Then, go to 'web' folder and run:
pnpm i
# so that we update the dependencies we we manually changed in the package.json



# Now, we'll focus on the backend
# Create a folder api/ and inside it run:
pnpm init

# We'll create this backend from scratch (manually). Here we'll use tsx because it has some nice features
# that the typescript support from ndoe does not include yet, such as aliases for relative imports with @ symbol.
pnpm i typescript @types/node tsx -D

# Now we create a config for typescript:
pnpm tsc --init

# Check out the version of node we have installed
node --version

# Then go to this webside
https://github.com/tsconfig/bases

# and choose the corresponding node version you got. You can either install the package, or
# you can just copy the content of your created tsconfig.json with theirs.

# The only thing we are going to include in this tsconfig.json is to add an alias to make
# our imports simpler. Inside the compilerOptions add the following:
"paths": {
  "@/*": ["./src/*"]
}
