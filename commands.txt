# Here we will create a mono-repo that will have both the backend API and the frontend in React.
# The mono-repo idea is interesting because it shares common dependencies and allow front and backend to share types and some common definitions.

pnpm init   # this creates a package.json

pnpm create vite@latest web  # the name of the project is 'web'

# in this command select the options:
◇  Select a framework:
│  React
│
◇  Select a variant:
│  TypeScript
│
◇  Use rolldown-vite (Experimental)?:
│  No
│
◇  Install with pnpm and start now?
│  Yes


# After this initial setup, I cleaned the 'web' project, removing some stuff we're not going to use.
# Then, go to 'web' folder and run:
pnpm i
# so that we update the dependencies we we manually changed in the package.json
